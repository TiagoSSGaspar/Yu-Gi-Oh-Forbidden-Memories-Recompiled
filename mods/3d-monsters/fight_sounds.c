/* The fighters' own sounds, as the 3D arena plays them.
 *
 * Each MODEL.MRG record carries its monster's sounds: sector 224 is the
 * sequence bank the arena registers (SD_LoadSequenceBankPair: 32 driver ids,
 * each with a note record), sectors 225-274 the ADPCM samples it puts in SPU
 * RAM at 0xD810 (+0x19000 for the second slot), and sector 275 starts with
 * the slot's sound_entries, which the load copies even when it is quiet.
 * In the arena func_8005106C plays an entry when the slot's row is the
 * entry's and its time passes the entry's: SD_SEPlay(0x4000 | id), which
 * the driver turns through the bank into the note's voice.
 *
 * In the duel none of that can be loaded where the arena has it: the bank
 * goes to 0x801A8000, which holds the opponent's AI script, registering it
 * drops every sound id the duel registered (func_8004763C), and the samples
 * would go over the duel's own in SPU RAM, which the duel and its music
 * leave all but 39 KB of. So the sounds are decoded here and played by the
 * host (host->sound_add, API 12), on the sound-effect channels the audio
 * replacement mixes (src/pc/audio/replace.c), under the sound-effect volume.
 * Each note plays as the driver's sound-effect voice would play it
 * (func_8004803C): at its own pitch against the voices' sample note 0x3C00,
 * at its volume, and keyed off after its timer (timer << 2 ticks, one a
 * VBlank). The rows' XA entries (0x8000), the arena's voice clips off the
 * disc, are left out. */
