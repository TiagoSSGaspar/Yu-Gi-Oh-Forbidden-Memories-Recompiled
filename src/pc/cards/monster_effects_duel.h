/* Monster effects in a duel (monster_effects.h has what a card may do).
 *
 * The duel has no one place where a monster is summoned or destroyed, so
 * the field is looked at whenever it has settled: as a hand or field phase
 * begins, no card effect or presentation running. What changed in the
 * monster zones since the last look is what happened -- a card placement
 * put down face up was summoned (a face-down one was not), one that left was
 * destroyed unless placement put another in its zone (fusion material) or a
 * ritual took it (a tribute). Each change fires once, then the look is the
 * new reference. A face-down monster attacked is flipped: as in Yu-Gi-Oh!,
 * the battle runs as ever and its flip resolves after it, at the next
 * look, before what the battle destroyed. The effects resolve one at a
 * time, a retail magic
 * card's effect through the game's own card-effect dispatch, which keeps
 * the duel waiting just as playing the card does.
 *
 * "combat" fires as a battle starts (no trap sprang), its boosts lasting
 * the battle; "face_up" boosts are worked out whenever the
 * game asks a card's ATK/DEF (Duel_CalcCardStats), so the field, the
 * battle, traps and the CPU's view of the board all see them, each source
 * once on each monster it reaches, newcomers too. A "for_each" counts the
 * face-up monsters of the last look (and a battle's two): a face_up boost
 * as it is asked, the others as they are made.
 *
 * The state is the game's (src/pc/game/trigger_state.c), in save states. */
