/* What two or more mods both change, and which of them the game then uses
 * (notes/modding.md, "When mods overlap"). Warnings only: nothing here
 * changes what loads or who wins; it reads the manifests (and the files they
 * name: texture packs, text listings, pool files, the duelists folder) the
 * way the readers do (src/pc/cards/tables.c, stars.c, cards.c, mods.c,
 * title_config.c) and says where they meet.
 *
 * The mods come in load order, earliest first, which is what decides most
 * overlaps: the later mod wins. Some keys add up instead (drop and deck
 * pool edits, starter decks and pools, title text lines), which is said too,
 * as information rather than a warning. Each overlap is one line, built when
 * asked for (a mod of every fusion pair has 261,003 of them). One line may
 * name a single mod: starter pools that do not draw a deck's forty cards,
 * which the game leaves out however many mods wrote them (when two mods or
 * more are listed; one mod alone has no overlaps).
 *
 * The FM Editor makes the same check in Python
 * (tools/pc/fm_editor/overlaps.py); tests/pc/mod_overlaps holds the mods and
 * the lines both must find, in order. */
