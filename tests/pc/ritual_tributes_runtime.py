"""Rituals of one to five tributes, from the field, the hand or both, played
in the built game (needs the player's disc).

A mod written for the run (in --out, never in the repository) gives some of
the disc's ritual cards new recipes ("tributes" of 1 to 5, "tributes_from"),
and fixes Simon Muran's deck to Forest so that nothing of the player's is
attacked while the field is built. Each scenario is a duel against him
reached with goto(), the deck dealt in the order it needs; the player's
plays go through the pad as a player's do. What each checks:

  retail      Ultimate Dragon's own recipe (three Blue-eyes on the field)
  one         one tribute from the field, the result in its zone
  hand        two from the hand only, the field empty: the first free zone
  both        four from hand and field: a hand copy before a field one
  five        five from the field; before it a hand ritual with the field
              full is refused
  refused     a hand ritual whose tribute is on the field, and a field one
              whose tribute is in the hand, take nothing
  cpu         the CPU plays a hand ritual and a one-tribute field ritual

Each pass writes pictures to --out/<pass>/ (look at them). With
--interpreter the scenarios run again with the duel effects interpreted
(MEMORIES_DUEL_EFFECTS=interpreter, the disc's own MIPS): the outcome must
be the same and nothing may crash. --editor makes the mod with the FM
Editor's model and manifest instead of writing it here.
