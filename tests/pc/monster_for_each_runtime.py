"""Monster effects "for each" (notes/more-cards.md, "Monster effects"):
boosts and LP made once per face-up monster counted, played in the built
game (needs the player's disc).

The mod is written for the run with the FM Editor's model and manifest
(in --out, never in the repository). It gives disc monsters effects:

  Baby Dragon       while face up, +300/+300 for each face-up Dragon on its
                    owner's field (itself one of them)
  Hitotsu-me Giant  while face up, +200 ATK for each face-up Dragon on the
                    whole field
  Mystical Elf      while face up, +400/+400 for each face-up Dragon on the
                    opponent's field
  Mushroom Man      while face up, +100/+100 for each face-up Light monster
                    on the field
  Feral Imp         on summon, its owner gains 100 LP for each face-up
                    Dragon on the field

and fixes Simon Muran's deck to Red Medicine, so that he plays nothing on
the field unless a scenario deals him monsters. What each scenario checks
(the ATK and DEF the game shows -- the field's info panel for the card
under the cursor, Duel_CalcCardStats -- against the cards' own stats and
modifiers and the count):

  count      0, 1 and 3 Dragons: the Giant before any, Baby Dragon counting
             itself, a face-down Winged Dragon not counted, then counted
             once its attack flips it; Mushroom Man counting Blue-eyes (Light)
  opponent   the CPU's Baby Dragons (put down face up for their effect) are
             counted by the Elf and the Giant, not by the player's Baby
             Dragon; the CPU's own count; one destroyed in battle takes its
             count away, the battle's damage matching the shown ATK
  fusion     a fusion's Dragon (B. Dragon Jungle King) counted as it lands;
             Dragon Treasure on Baby Dragon: its +500 and the count add up
  heal       Feral Imp's summon heals 100 per Dragon on the field
  duel       a whole duel against a CPU with Dragons, played turn by turn to
             its end: after each turn every face-up monster's shown stats
             match, the records' modifiers stay as they were, and each
             battle's LP change matches the stats shown before it

Each pass writes pictures to --out/<pass>/shots (look at them). With
--interpreter the scenarios run again with the duel effects interpreted
(MEMORIES_DUEL_EFFECTS=interpreter).
